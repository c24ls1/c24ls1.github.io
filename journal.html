Entry 3: I learned how to make arrays, & if/else statements. I added arrays to my chess project in order to be able to move the pieces, take other pieces by dragging, etc. I also added arrays in my tic tac toe codesketch to be able to click on all boxes, and not have to make a separate function for each of the 400+ divs. I’ve also used arrays to make a circle that changes to a random color every time it’s clicked, which doesn’t really have any purpose, it was just for fun. Yesterday I started to make a codesketch which lets you play music, pause it, change volume, etc. I’m trying to figure out how to change the song on the user’s side, and whether to use a drop-down menu or editable text.

Entry 2: I started working on a chessboard, but I don’t know how to make the pieces move yet, I’ll probably schedule a lab to figure that out later. My amoeba (basically big tic tac toe) project is going well too, I think I have to use if/else statements to make the X’s and O’s - will learn how to do this later. For now only the first 3 boxes are usable. I’m also working on a canvas, and while the layout is how I want it to be, I still have to work on the functionality. Basically, I have the visuals & audio for all my projects, and I need to work on the functional parts next.

Entry 1: I just finished making my Piano, finally added event listeners for the notes. I also learned how to add box shadow to the notes to make them look a little nicer. I’m making a list of things I want to work on in the future, for now I’m thinking about making a chessboard but I don’t know where to start on that.
